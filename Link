But if we search for the same data by filtering the Ship_Quarter partitioning column:
SELECT * FROM DBO.Shipments_Info WHERE [Ship_Quarter] = 3

SET STATISTICS TIME ON
SELECT * FROM DBO.Shipments_Info WHERE [Ship_Num] = 1119
GO
SELECT * FROM DBO.Shipments_Info WHERE [Ship_Quarter] = 3
SET STATISTICS TIME OFF
